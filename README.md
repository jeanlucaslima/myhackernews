Yet another hacker news plugin

This is a simple tampermonkey-compatible user script that:

* Adds dark theme to HN
* Changes the top menu by:
  - Adds `best` menu item that sends to `/best`
  - Adds `active` menu item that sends to `/active`
  - Removes `jobs` and `submit` itens

For now that is all.

This was all made in 30min with chatgpt help, please do not install it without
reviewing the code first.
