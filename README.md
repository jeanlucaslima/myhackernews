Yet another hacker news plugin

This is a simple tampermonkey-compatible user script that:

* Adds dark theme to HN
* Changes the top menu by:
* Adds best menu item that sends to /best
* Adds active menu item that sends to /active
* Removes jobs and submit itens

For now that is all.

# Releases

* Moved to greasyfork (openuserjs does not allow login)
* Testing out new themes (with new theme support)
* Several bugs fixed - top padding, visited links, better readability
